# Push Instructions for v2.1.0 Release

## Issue Identified

The release workflow failed with:
```
HTTP 422: Validation Failed
Release.tag_name already exists
```

**Root Cause:** The tag `v2.1.0` existed but the workflow didn't handle existing releases gracefully.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Added idempotent release creation:** Checks if release exists and deletes/recreates it
- **Fixed release notes generation:** Improved previous tag detection logic
- **Better error handling:** More robust asset upload process

### 2. Recreated Tag
- Deleted old v2.1.0 tag
- Created new v2.1.0 tag pointing to commit `226de45` (includes workflow fix)

## Push Commands

Run these commands to push everything to GitHub:

```bash
cd /Users/richgodusen/Documents/MSc\ Programme/THESIS/bffgen

# Push all commits to master
git push origin master

# Delete the old tag on remote (if it exists)
git push origin :refs/tags/v2.1.0

# Push the new tag
git push origin v2.1.0
```

## What Will Happen

1. **Commits pushed:** All fixes will be available on GitHub
2. **Tag pushed:** The v2.1.0 tag will trigger the release workflow
3. **Workflow runs:** 
   - Builds binaries for all platforms
   - Runs all tests (should pass âœ…)
   - Checks if v2.1.0 release exists (it might)
   - Deletes existing release and recreates it
   - Uploads all binary assets
   - Publishes to npm (if NPM_TOKEN is configured)

## Monitor Progress

After pushing, monitor the release workflow:
1. Go to: https://github.com/RichGod93/bffgen/actions
2. Look for "Release" workflow triggered by "v2.1.0" tag
3. Watch the progress (should take ~5-10 minutes)

## Expected Outcome

âœ… Release v2.1.0 created with:
- 5 platform binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- checksums.txt file
- Full release notes
- npm package published (if configured)

## If Issues Occur

### Workflow Still Fails
Check the Actions logs for specific errors:
- Build failures â†’ Check Go code compilation
- Test failures â†’ Check test logs
- Asset upload failures â†’ Check file permissions

### npm Publish Fails
If npm publishing fails (likely due to missing NPM_TOKEN):
- The main release will still succeed
- Publish manually: `cd npm && npm publish`

## Verification Steps

After successful release:

```bash
# Verify GitHub release exists
gh release view v2.1.0

# Download and test a binary
curl -L -o bffgen https://github.com/RichGod93/bffgen/releases/download/v2.1.0/bffgen-darwin-amd64
chmod +x bffgen
./bffgen --version  # Should output: v2.1.0

# Verify npm package (if published)
npm view bffgen version  # Should output: 2.1.0
```
